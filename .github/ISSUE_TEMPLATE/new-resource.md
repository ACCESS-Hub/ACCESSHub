Thank you for sharing a resource with the ACCESS community

If there is a new resource you would like to add to the ACCESS-Hive Docs please include the following information:

- [ ] link to the resource: this can include multiple "sub links". Please indicate the nature of the sub-links,  e.g. `docs`, `source-code`, `tutorials`, `getting-started`
- [ ] short description to accompany the link
- [ ] category and sub-category where this resource should sit in the ACCESS-Hive Docs structure (see below for details of categories)

The site has an excellent in-built search facility, so the description plays an important role in people finding your resource, and assessing if this is of interest to them.

The [`models/model_components/atmosphere`](/models/model_components/atmosphere) section also has some great examples to assist with drafting your submission.

Once you have submitted this issue please [contribute the change yourself](/about/contribute) if you have the time. The more the community contributes to this resource, the better it becomes and the burden to maintain and improve it Is spread more widely.
